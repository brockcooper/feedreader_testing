# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. I designed the test suite for this application to ensure the application is functioning as intended.


## Getting Started
1. Run index.html in your browser
1. index.html includes the Jasmine test results at the botton of the application
1. All tests seen on the should be passing on the index.html view
1. Specs are found in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
1. Jasmine test suite tests the functionality of the application, and more specifically the index.html, css/syle.css, and js/app.js files
